These are D bindings to the C interface of libs3.

Introduction from libs3's homepage:
---
> The libs3 project implements a complete C library API for Amazon S3. It is intended to be easy to use, comprehensive, and suitable for use from any C or C++ program. 
> This library provides an API for using Amazon's S3 service (see http://s3.amazonaws.com). Its design goals are: 

>  - To provide a simple and straightforward API for accessing all of S3's functionality
>  - To not require the developer using libs3 to need to know anything about HHTP, XML, or SSL

Library Version: 3.2.0

License: The s3 library uses the GNU GPL version 3, and the D bindings carry
the same copyright and license as the C headers.

Status: The bindings should be complete, but they have not been thoroughly
tested at this point. Please submit pull requests.
